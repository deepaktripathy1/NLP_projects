Outside the office, authorities\nallege that the 45-year-old longtime officer worked with a drug\ntrafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns.  A\ncriminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey\nTuesday accuses Mata, also known as \"The Milk Man,\" of using his role\nas a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in\nexchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch.  In one\ninstance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to\nkill rival drug dealers.  The killers would pose as cops, pulling over\ntheir targets before shooting them, according to the complaint.\n\"Ultimately, the (organization) decided not to move forward with the\nmurder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the\nmeetings,\" federal prosecutors said in a statement.  The complaint\nalso alleges that Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for\ndrug traffickers.  Mata, according to the complaint, then used\ncontacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry-on\nluggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic.  Court\ndocuments released by investigators do not specify the name of the\ndrug trafficking organization with which Mata allegedly conspired but\nsays the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as\nEcuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them \"inside shipping\ncontainers containing pallets of produce, including bananas.\"  The\norganization \"has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and\nelsewhere,\" the complaint says.  Authorities arrested Mata on Tuesday\nin Miami Gardens, Florida.  It was not immediately clear whether Mata\nhas an attorney, and police officials could not be immediately reached\nfor comment.  Mata has worked for the Miami-Dade Police Department\nsince 1992, including directing investigations in Miami Gardens and\nworking as a lieutenant in the K-9 unit at Miami International\nAirport, according to the complaint.  Since March 2010, he had been\nworking in the internal affairs division.  Mata faces charges of\naiding and abetting a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiring to\ndistribute cocaine and engaging in monetary transactions in property\nderived from specified unlawful activity.  He is scheduled to appear\nin federal court in Florida on Wednesday.  If convicted, Mata could\nface life in prison.

Outside the office, authorities\nallege that the 45-year-old longtime officer worked with a drug\ntrafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns.  A\ncriminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey\nTuesday accuses Mata, also known as \"The Milk Man,\" of using his role\nas a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in\nexchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch.  In one\ninstance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to\nkill rival drug dealers.  The killers would pose as cops, pulling over\ntheir targets before shooting them, according to the complaint.\n\"Ultimately, the (organization) decided not to move forward with the\nmurder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the\nmeetings,\" federal prosecutors said in a statement.  The complaint\nalso alleges that Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for\ndrug traffickers.  Mata, according to the complaint, then used\ncontacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry-on\nluggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic.  Court\ndocuments released by investigators do not specify the name of the\ndrug trafficking organization with which Mata allegedly conspired but\nsays the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as\nEcuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them \"inside shipping\ncontainers containing pallets of produce, including bananas.\"  The\norganization \"has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and\nelsewhere,\" the complaint says.  Authorities arrested Mata on Tuesday\nin Miami Gardens, Florida.  It was not immediately clear whether Mata\nhas an attorney, and police officials could not be immediately reached\nfor comment.  Mata has worked for the Miami-Dade Police Department\nsince 1992, including directing investigations in Miami Gardens and\nworking as a lieutenant in the K-9 unit at Miami International\nAirport, according to the complaint.  Since March 2010, he had been\nworking in the internal affairs division.  Mata faces charges of\naiding and abetting a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiring to\ndistribute cocaine and engaging in monetary transactions in property\nderived from specified unlawful activity.  He is scheduled to appear\nin federal court in Florida on Wednesday.  If convicted, Mata could\nface life in prison.

The grand adventure promises to deliver up and close and personal moments with some of the world's most elusive and enchanting wildlife. Scroll down for video . The adventure promises to deliver up and close and personal moments with some of the world's most elusive and enchanting wildlife . To mark its 10th anniversary, Natural World Safaris has launched a new series of ‘Ultimate Safari’ adventures. Divided into four areas: Primates, Bears, Big Cats and Marine Life, the safari can be taken separately, but also as an epic world tour over 203 days, taking in 21 destinations. On each ‘Ultimate Safari’, guests will be guided across the globe on a carefully planned itinerary, taking them through Africa, Asia and the Indian Subcontinent to the Polar Regions and Latin America for rare wildlife encounters. Each safari can be split into separate legs, or completed in one journey. They will be accompanied by expert guides, optimising the visitors encounters with wildlife, ensuring they are in the right place at the right time. The Ultimate Bear Safari tracks polar bears, grizzly bears and spirit bears in Arctic Canada, the Arctic Circle, Alaska and British Columbia . The rarest animal that guests can hope to see is the critically endangered Siberian Tiger in Russia. With a population currently stabilised at under 400, sightings in the wild are extremely rare as Siberian tigers have the largest home range of any tiger subspecies. Accommodation ranges from pure luxury such as Shangri- La Rasa Ria, a large resort with its own orang-utan sanctuary, to basic cabins in Russia’s Durminskoye Forest Reserve, the best place to experience the habitat of the elusive Siberian Tiger. They can spend nights in eco lodges like the domes at Patagonia Eco Camp in Chile, and aboard ships such as the MS Malmo, a maritime vessel with heritage listing and the Jaguar House Boat moored on the north side of Taima Island, one of the best places in the world to see jaguars in the wild.

Price £176,000 . Destinations 21 . Total Days- 203 . www.naturalworldsafaris.com . For those with a budget weighty enough to take on the whole 201 day extravaganza, there would be some overlap in terms of destinations, for example- tours to Svalbard appear on both the Marine safari, for narwhals, and the bear safari, for polar bears. So the option of dividing it up may be appealing. The Big Cat section takes intrepid nature fans to ten different locations, starting in Latin America to track pumas and jaguars, before heading off to Africa for cheetahs, lions and leopards. Guests will then visit Asia for Asian leopards, Asiatic lions, snow leopards and tigers, before finishing in Russia looking for the biggest cat of them all, the Siberian tiger. The Asiatic lion (left) and the Bengal tiger (right) are just two of the big cats safari participants can expect to see on their travels . The countries that will be visited are Brazil, Chile, South Africa, Tanzania, Kenya, Sri Lanka, India and Russia. As a separate trip, the 62 day Ultimate Big Cat Safari starts from £45,000 per person including international and internal flights, transfers and all meals.

But Gaioz Nigalidze's ideas from the loo were a little too good. The Georgian chess grandmaster has been banned from the Dubai Open Chess Tournament after officials discovered he was darting to the toilet to consult his smartphone, which was logged onto a chess analysis app, the Dubai Chess and Culture Club said. Nigalidze's opponent, Tigran Petrosian of Armenia, grew suspicious when Nigalidze kept bolting to the restroom. \"The Armenian noticed the Georgian was oddly frequenting the toilet after each move during a crucial part of the game,\" the Dubai Chess and Culture Club said. When officials first checked Nigalidze, they didn't find any device on him, the club said. But after looking into the bathroom stall he visited, they found the smartphone hidden in toilet paper. At first, Nigalidze claimed the smartphone wasn't his, the Dubai chess organization said. But the phone was logged on to a social media network under his account. \"They also found his game being analyzed in one of the chess applications,\" the chess club said. The infraction has been reported to the International Chess Federation. The Dubai tournament's chief arbiter, Mahdi Abdul Rahim, said players found guilty of cheating will be suspended for three years from all sanctioned tournaments and up to 15 years for a repeated offense, the chess and culture club said. But this wouldn't be an isolated case of cheating in high-stakes chess matches.
